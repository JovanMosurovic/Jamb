# Yamb

This repository contains a Python script for implementing the classic dice game "Yamb". The code contains functions for rolling dice, managing the scoring matrix, performing calculations for valid moves and displaying the game interface.
> One of my goals was to experiment with various random number generators such as the Linear Congruential Generator, Blum Blum Shub, and Lagged Fibonacci Generator. Among these options, I was assigned to use Blum Blum Shub generator.
> 
> The script was developed as the [first homework assignment](instructions.pdf) for the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, majoring in Software Engineering. 

## Features

- Rolling dice using the Blum Blum Shub algorithm.
- Tracking scores and making entries on a scorecard.
- Offering options for saving dice rolls and choosing where to place scores.
- Implementing different scoring rules like Kenta, Ful, Poker, and Jamb.
- Providing a friend's help option to make a decision.

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Follow the on-screen menu instructions to play the game:
   - Start a game.
   - Roll dice.
   - Choose where to place your score.
   - View the current scorecard.
   - Exit the game.
  
3. Use the "Pomoc prijatelja" (Friend's Help) option to receive assistance from an algorithm for your next move.
4. Continue playing until you complete the scorecard or decide to exit.
